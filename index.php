                <p>RebelLUG is a private, online LEGO® User Group made up of independent creators from YouTube, Instagram, and Flickr.
                    We were founded in 2015 as something to call our group of seven friends so we could work on bigger group projects together,
                    under a single name. Since then we’ve grown to 45 members across 12 countries. Our LEGO® collaborations happen online or at
                    conventions across the globe. Our goal is to provide an environment for our members to grow and build LEGO® in new, creative ways.
                    We also strive to encourage other members of the online LEGO® community to do the same.</p>
