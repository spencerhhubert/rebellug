                <p>The Laceropes Mission is an original Star Wars story by RebelLUG like no other LEGO collaboration project before. It is proudly sponsored by <a href="https://avfigures.com" target="_blank">AV Figures</a>, who helped us create Validus Squad, a four member clone squad of completly custom LEGO minifigures. The squad was available for purchase in limited quantites from AV Figures.</p>
                <p>This collaboration was premiered at Brickworld Chicago 2019 and released entirely online on June 22nd, 2019.</p>

                    <p>“Validus squad landed on Laceropes and met up with the base camp a little over two hours ago. The Republic’s campaign on Laceropes has been underway for over two standard weeks and we’re headed to their base, located in a small town in what seems to be the remains of a temple. The mission summary stated the natives of Laceropes, groups of monks, had different factions defending them in this conflict. It’s believed that a Republic admiral, Admiral Oris Ski, was captured by a group of native allies and he’s potentially being tortured for information. Our mission is to bring him home or find out if he was killed.”</p>

Chancellor Palpatine personally made it clear that mining them and the taking control of the planet’s capitol was necessary to the war effort.
