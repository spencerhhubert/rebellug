            <p>The Battlefront contest was exclusive to RebelLUG members, but we encouraged our followers to vote on who the winners of each round would be. Each week a new planet from Star Wars was used as the challenge (picked by the previous week's winner) and members created vignettes taking place on that planet.</p>
            <p>The contest started August 18, 2017 and lasted seven weeks.</p>
